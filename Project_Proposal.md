## Abstract:
Indie game developers are facing a major discoverability challenge on game purchasing platforms, specifically Steam. Thousands of new titles are released each year on Steam, decreasing visibility for many high-quality games. Due to Steam's unclear recommendation and tagging systems, developers are unable to understand the various factors such as genre, tags, price, release timing, and user reception, that affect a game’s visibility. Without a clear understanding of these factors, issues with discoverability remain unsolved in the gaming industry and continue to negatively impact developers, especially small studios with limited marketing resources.

This project aims to address the discoverability challenge on Steam plaguing small studios in particular by creating an interactive dashboard that explores multivariate relationships in a large Steam games dataset. Through the implementation of visual views, filtering, and details on demand, our dashboard will help users identify patterns related to increased and decreased discoverability. These patterns will include trends related to which game characteristics are associated with higher visibility or under served niches. Overall, the goal of this project is to provide developers with a data driven tool to better understand the marketplace and make informed decisions regarding how to market and position their games.

## Problem Description:
The problem this project addresses is the discoverability crisis affecting indie game developers on Steam. In the past decade, the number of games released annually on Steam has grown drastically, some estimates indicating the amount of games released in a single year exceed the quantity released in the platform's first decade even. This over saturation on the platform makes it significantly more difficult for smaller studios to achieve visibility for even their highest quality games. Not to mention, prior research consistently highlights that visibility on Steam is not determined solely by game quality, but by a complex combination of factors including genre competition, tag selections, release timing, pricing, and user reviews. A major challenge in Steam’s automated recommendations, algorithmic lists, user-generated tagging, and other discovery mechanisms is they lack transparency. This poses another significant challenge to developers attempting to increase their games visibility as they cannot easily acertain why certain games gain traction while others remain invisible. Some platforms such as SteamSpy have attempted to provide partial statistical insights as to what influences visibility, yet there is no accessible visual analytics tool that allows developers to interactively explore the multivariate relationships that influence game visibility. Consequently, studios oftentimes make critical decisions regarding their game's attributes without understanding how certain attributes may have impacted discoverability for similar games. Many indie developers rely on discoverability to succeed because they lack marketing budgets, established fans, or publisher support. This means with such an extensive information gap and without tools to analyze attribute patterns across games, these developers struggle to differentiate their titles in oversaturated genres. Through revealing how game attributes collectively influence discoverability, this project seeks to address a real industry problem that currently lacks a transparent, data-driven solution.
