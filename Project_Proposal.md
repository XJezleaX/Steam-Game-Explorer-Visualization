## Abstract:
Indie game developers are facing a major discoverability challenge on game purchasing platforms, specifically Steam. Thousands of new titles are released each year on Steam, decreasing visibility for many high-quality games. Due to Steam's unclear recommendation and tagging systems, developers are unable to understand the various factors such as genre, tags, price, release timing, and user reception, that affect a game’s visibility. Without a clear understanding of these factors, issues with discoverability remain unsolved in the gaming industry and continue to negatively impact developers, especially small studios with limited marketing resources.

This project aims to address the discoverability challenge on Steam plaguing small studios in particular by creating an interactive dashboard that explores multivariate relationships in a large Steam games dataset. Through the implementation of visual views, filtering, and details on demand, our dashboard will help users identify patterns related to increased and decreased discoverability. These patterns will include trends related to which game characteristics are associated with higher visibility or under served niches. Overall, the goal of this project is to provide developers with a data driven tool to better understand the marketplace and make informed decisions regarding how to market and position their games.

## Problem Description:
The problem this project addresses is the discoverability crisis affecting indie game developers on Steam. In the past decade, the number of games released annually on Steam has grown drastically, some estimates indicating the amount of games released in a single year exceed the quantity released in the platform's first decade even. This over saturation on the platform makes it significantly more difficult for smaller studios to achieve visibility for even their highest quality games. Not to mention, prior research consistently highlights that visibility on Steam is not determined solely by game quality, but by a complex combination of factors including genre competition, tag selections, release timing, pricing, and user reviews. A major challenge in Steam’s automated recommendations, algorithmic lists, user-generated tagging, and other discovery mechanisms is they lack transparency. This poses another significant challenge to developers attempting to increase their games visibility as they cannot easily acertain why certain games gain traction while others remain invisible. Some platforms such as SteamSpy have attempted to provide partial statistical insights as to what influences visibility, yet there is no accessible visual analytics tool that allows developers to interactively explore the multivariate relationships that influence game visibility. Consequently, studios oftentimes make critical decisions regarding their game's attributes without understanding how certain attributes may have impacted discoverability for similar games. Many indie developers rely on discoverability to succeed because they lack marketing budgets, established fans, or publisher support. This means with such an extensive information gap and without tools to analyze attribute patterns across games, these developers struggle to differentiate their titles in oversaturated genres. Through revealing how game attributes collectively influence discoverability, this project seeks to address a real industry problem that currently lacks a transparent, data-driven solution.

## Background & Novelty:
Prior research on Steam's ecosystem primarily focused on isolated metrics such as sales estimates, review trends, or genre popularity. Tools such as SteamSpy and SteamCharts provide limited statistics regarding what influences visibility, but they do not offer multivariate analytics or interactive exploration. Similarly, academic studies have examined the impact of user reviews on sales and the role of tags in content discovery, but this research rarely connects multiple attributes together and is oftentimes static. Additionally, existing tools fail to provide deeper understanding as to why some games become discoverable while others remain overlooked. Steam’s algorithms and store placement mechanisms are opaque, and no current resource enables developers to explore relationships between price, tags, review volume, release timing, and genre saturation in an integrated way. As a result, developers are oftentimes left to rely on a trial and error process or advice from other developers when allocating attributes to their game. This oftentimes leads to an incorrect selection of attributes due to the lack of data driven insights. 

The novelty of this project topic lies in its focus on multivariate visual analytics for discoverability, an area where no comprehensive interactive tool currently exists. Through the combination of linked views, filtering, and details-on-demand, our dashboard will allow users to examine complex attribute relationships that are impossible to see in static charts or single-variable analyses of data. Disimilar to existing tools, our approach will enable the exploration of nuanced patterns such as which tag combinations correlate with higher visibility, how genre oversaturation affects review volume, or how price interacts with player reception. 

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project is the Steam Games Dataset on Kaggle by Martin Bustos, a large real-world collection of metadata about video games available on the Steam platform. This dataset was compiled from sources such as the Steam Store API and SteamSpy, and contains information on tens of thousands of games released over a multitude years. The file also contains a wide range of attributes that describe each game’s characteristics, such as title, genre, tags, release date, price, developer, publisher, user ratings, and review counts. Given the wide range of attributes, we will be able to utilize a rich multivariate structure to explore complex relationships related to discoverability in our project. For example, tags and genres will be utilized to gain insight into content and themes price and release date introduce economic and temporal dimensions, and review scores, review counts, and rating ratios reveal player reception. Due to the datasets reflection of real marketplace patterns on Steam, it offers an ideal foundation for investigating the discoverability challenges faced by indie developers.

## Proposed Visualization Approach:
Our proposed visualization approach will utilize Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that helps users explore the different factors that may influence a games visibility level on Steam. Tableau maintains a variety of tools to help connect multiple charts together, create filtering functionality, and allow people to interact with data, perfectly aligning with our goal of building a dashboard to analyze many of these variables at once. The attributes we intend to hone in on are ratings, review count, price, release year, genre, and tags, as these are the most crucial in understanding why indie games visibility levels vary.

Firstly, our dashboard will begin with a large overview scatterplot that shows the relationship between a game’s rating and its review count, using color, size, and shape to add extra information regarding price or genre. Then, users will maintain the functionality to apply filters such as selecting certain price ranges, narrowing down specific genres, or adjusting the range of release years. On the application of a filter, all charts on the dashboard will update to help users focus on certain types of games or specific market segments. Additional visualizations will also be included to highlight other patterns in the data: bar charts that show which genres are overcrowded, line charts that track how different genres have changed over time, and heatmaps to compare tag usage or game characteristics. It is imperative to note, we intend to link each of these views so that choices in one chart affect all the others. Lastly, we will utilize Tableau’s built in details on demand features to allow users to hover over or click on any game to see extra information.
