## Abstract:
Indie game developers are facing a major discoverability challenge on game purchasing platforms, specifically Steam. Thousands of new titles are released each year on Steam, decreasing visibility for many high-quality games. Due to Steam's unclear recommendation and tagging systems, developers are unable to understand the various factors such as genre, tags, price, release timing, and user reception, that affect a game’s visibility. Without a clear understanding of these factors, issues with discoverability remain unsolved in the gaming industry and continue to negatively impact developers, especially small studios with limited marketing resources.

This project aims to address the discoverability challenge on Steam plaguing small studios in particular by creating an interactive dashboard that explores multivariate relationships in a large Steam games dataset. Through the implementation of visual views, filtering, and details on demand, our dashboard will help users identify patterns related to increased and decreased discoverability. These patterns will include trends related to which game characteristics are associated with higher visibility or under served niches. Overall, the goal of this project is to provide developers with a data driven tool to better understand the marketplace and make informed decisions regarding how to market and position their games.
